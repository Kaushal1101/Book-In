Book-In Website

This website was built for my Army unit in the Singapore Armed Forces. Replacing the outdated method of physically signing forms, the website allowed soldiers to book in and out inside camp premises using their phones. Created with a fellow soldier, we used Python and SQL extensively on the backend to validate requests and error handling. The Flask template website was deployed using heroku and earned letters of recognition from our Officer Commanding.
